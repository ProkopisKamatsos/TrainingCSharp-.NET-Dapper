# Implement Interfaces in a Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# Console Application** that demonstrates how to **define and implement interfaces** to achieve clean design, abstraction, and loose coupling between components.

It was developed as a practice project to understand how interfaces support **polymorphism**, **dependency inversion**, and scalable application structure.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand how **interfaces** work in C#
- Separate **contracts** from implementations
- Apply **polymorphism** in real scenarios
- Improve code maintainability and extensibility
- Practice interface-based design principles

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Interface definition and implementation
- Multiple interface implementation
- Polymorphism via interfaces
- Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
- Loose coupling between classes
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Console-based application flow

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
- **Modern C# language features**
