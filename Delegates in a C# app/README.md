# Delegates in a C# App

## 📌 Overview

This project contains examples that demonstrate how **delegates** work in C#.  
It focuses on how methods can be passed as parameters, assigned to variables, and used to implement callback-style behavior in a type-safe way.

The purpose is to practice fundamental event-style programming constructs and understand how delegates enable flexible behavior in applications.
