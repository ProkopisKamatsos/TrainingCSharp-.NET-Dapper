# Enum, Struct, and Record in a Banking Application

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# Console Application** that demonstrates the use of **Enum**, **Struct**, and **Record** types in the context of a simple **banking system**.

It was developed as a practice project to understand modern C# features and how they are applied in real-world domain modeling.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand the differences between **enum**, **struct**, and **record**
- Apply these types in a realistic banking scenario
- Practice **immutability** and **value-based equality**
- Model domain concepts clearly and safely
- Work with modern C# syntax and features

---
