# Create Class Definitions and Instantiate Objects

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **defining C# classes and creating objects** from them.  
It was built to reinforce the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#, specifically how classes represent data and behavior, and how objects are instantiated and used within an application.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Learn how to **define classes** with fields, properties, and methods  
- Practice **creating and instantiating objects**  
- Understand how objects hold state and expose behavior  
- Use constructors to initialize object data  
- Access and manipulate object members in code

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Class creation and structure (fields, properties)
- Constructors and object initialization
- Instantiating objects with `new`
- Using object members (methods & properties)
- Understanding object state and behavior

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
