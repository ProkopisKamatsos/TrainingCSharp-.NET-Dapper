# Contoso Pizza Web API

## 📌 Overview

**Contoso Pizza** is a simple **ASP.NET Core Web API project** built to practice creating RESTful endpoints using C# and .NET.  
It provides basic pizza-related operations through HTTP requests and demonstrates how to structure a web service using controllers, models, and services.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey to understand how web APIs are built and consumed in real-world applications.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Learn how to build an **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- Understand routing and HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Practice designing and using **controllers and models**
- Implement services and dependency injection
- Handle data without an ORM (in-memory or minimal persistence)
- Explore how web APIs interact with clients

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Web API project structure (`Controllers`, `Models`, `Services`)
- RESTful design principles (CRUD endpoints)
- HTTP request handling (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Dependency Injection (`services.AddScoped`, etc.)
- Configuration and middleware in ASP.NET Core
- JSON request/response formatting
- Basic API testing (via browser, tools like Postman / HTTP clients)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET / ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Controllers & Routing**
- JSON serialization
- HTTP methods for REST
