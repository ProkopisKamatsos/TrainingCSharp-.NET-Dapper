# Task Management REST API (Major Practice Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# ASP.NET Core Web API** that implements a complete **Task Management System** using **Dapper** and **SQL Server**.

It was developed as a major practice project to simulate a real-world backend REST API, focusing on clean architecture, data access patterns, and proper API design.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Build a **RESTful Web API** with ASP.NET Core
- Perform full **CRUD operations** using **Dapper**
- Apply **Repository** and **Service** patterns
- Work directly with **SQL Server**
- Practice API validation, error handling, and HTTP status codes
- Prepare for real-world backend interview scenarios
