# Polymorphism in a C# Application

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# Console Application** that demonstrates **polymorphism** through inheritance and method overriding in a clear, practical example.

It was developed as a practice project to understand how polymorphism enables flexible and extensible object-oriented design in C#.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand **polymorphism** in object-oriented programming
- Use **base classes** and **derived classes**
- Apply **method overriding**
- Execute behavior dynamically at runtime
- Improve application extensibility

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Method overriding (`virtual` / `override`)
- Base class references
- Runtime behavior resolution
- Clean OOP design
- Console-based application flow

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
- **Modern C# language features**
