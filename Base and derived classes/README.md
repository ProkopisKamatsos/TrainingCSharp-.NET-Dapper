# Base and Derived Classes

## 📌 Overview

This project contains examples that explore **base classes, inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism** in C#.  
It was built to practice how object-oriented principles work in real code and how derived types extend base functionality.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goals of this project are to:

- Understand how **inheritance** works in C#
- Practice creating **base classes** and **derived classes**
- Learn how to use **virtual**, **override**, and **abstract** methods
- Explore **polymorphism** and runtime method binding

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Base vs. derived class relationships
- Class inheritance (`: BaseClass`)
- Virtual methods and method overriding
- Abstract classes and abstract methods
- Polymorphism and dynamic dispatch
- Code reuse and structure

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
