# Dapper MVC Demo

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **.NET MVC web application** that demonstrates how to build a typical CRUD-style app using **Dapper** for data access. It follows a layered approach (UI + data access logic) to keep the code organized and closer to real-world structure.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice building an **ASP.NET (Core) MVC** application end-to-end
- Use **Dapper** to run SQL commands/queries and map results to C# objects
- Implement basic **CRUD workflows** through MVC (Controller → View → Data)
- Learn how to separate responsibilities between UI, models, and database layer

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- ASP.NET MVC fundamentals (Controllers, Views, Models)
- Routing + action methods for CRUD operations
- Dapper data access (`Query*`, `Execute`) with parameterized SQL
- Mapping database records to POCO models
- Basic layering (UI vs data access / repository-style organization)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **C#**
- **.NET / ASP.NET MVC**
- **Dapper**
- **SQL Database** (e.g., SQL Server)
- **Razor Views (HTML/CSS)** (typical MVC UI)
