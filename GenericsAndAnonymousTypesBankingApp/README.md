# Generics and Anonymous Types in a Banking Application

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **C# Console Application** that demonstrates the use of **Generics** and **Anonymous Types** within a simple **banking application** scenario.

It was developed as a practice project to understand how generics improve code reusability and type safety, and how anonymous types can be used for temporary data shaping.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand **generic classes and methods**
- Apply generics in real-world banking logic
- Learn how and when to use **anonymous types**
- Improve type safety and reduce code duplication
- Practice clean and flexible data handling
