# Async vs Sync Execution with Task.Run

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the **difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution** in C# using `Task.Run`.

It was created as a learning exercise to better understand how tasks work, how threads are managed, and how asynchronous code affects program flow and performance.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** execution
- Learn how `Task.Run` works internally
- Observe how tasks run on **background threads**
- See how execution order changes when using async code

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Synchronous vs asynchronous programming
- `Task` and `Task.Run`
- Thread execution behavior
- Program flow and timing
- Basic concurrency concepts

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
